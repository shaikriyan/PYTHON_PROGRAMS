'''
python as caluculator
operators + - * / // % **
order of precedence is
1.parenthsis
2.exponentiation (right to left)
3.* / // % (left to right)
4. + -(left to right is associativity)
print(2**3**2)
print(2**6)
result=64


convections not so important 
 
 user_name_one="Riyan"  snake case writing mainly used in python
 userNameOne="Hari"     Camel case writing mainly used in java
